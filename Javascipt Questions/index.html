<!-- Question 1: Grade Calculator
Write a JavaScript program that asks for a student's score (0-100) and calculates the grade based on the score:
- A: 90 and above
- B: 80 to 89
- C: 70 to 79
- D: 60 to 69
- F: Below 60 -->
<!-- 
<script>
let score = parseInt(prompt("Enter the student's score (0-100):"));
if ( score >= 0 && score <= 100) {
    if (score >= 90) {
        document.write("The student's grade is: A");
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        document.write("The student's grade is: B");
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        document.write("The student's grade is: C");
    } else if (score >= 60) {
        document.write("The student's grade is: D");
    } else {
        document.write("The student's grade is: F");
    }
} else {
   document.write('Invalid score. Please enter a number between 0 and 100.');
}
</script> -->

 <!-- Question 2: Simple Authentication System
Create a simple JavaScript program that simulates a login system. Ask for a username and password. If the username is "admin" and the password is "12345", show a welcome message. Otherwise, display an error message. Consider different error messages for wrong username and wrong password. -->

<!-- <script>
    let username = prompt("Enter your username:");
    if (username === "admin") {
        document.write("Welcome, admin!");
        let password = prompt("Enter your password:");
        if (password === "12345") {
            document.write(" Correct password. Redirecting to another page...");
            window.location.href = "open_new_page.html";
        } else {
            document.write(" Incorrect password. Please try again.");
        }
    } else {
        document.write("Incorrect username. Please try again.");
    }
</script>
 -->

 <!-- Question 3:User Ticket Pricing System
 Write a JavaScript program that calculates ticket prices based on age:
 - Children under 5: Free
 - Age 5 to 12: $10
 - Age 13 to 60: $20
 - Seniors above 60: $15
 Ask for the age and display the ticket price accordingly. -->

<!-- <script>
let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"));

let ticketPrice;

if (age < 5) {
    ticketPrice = "Free";
} else if (age >= 5 && age <= 12) {
    ticketPrice = "$10";
} else if (age >= 13 && age <= 60) {
    ticketPrice = "$20";
} else {
    ticketPrice = "$15";
}

document.write(`The ticket price for age ${age} is ${ticketPrice}.`);

</script> -->
<!-- 

Question 4: Simple Calculator
Create a JavaScript program that acts as a simple calculator. It should first ask for an operation to perform (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and then ask for two numbers. Perform the operation on those two numbers. Use a nested `if` to first validate the operation and then calculate the result if the operation is valid. -->

    <!-- <script>
        let operation = prompt("Enter the operation to perform (add, subtract, multiply, divide):");

        if (operation === "+" || operation === "-" || operation === "*" || operation === "/") {
            let num1 = parseInt(prompt("Enter the first number:"));
            let num2 = parseInt(prompt("Enter the second number:"));

            let result;
            if (operation === "+") {
                result = num1 + num2;
                document.write(`The result of ${num1} ${operation} ${num2} is: ${result}`);

            } else if (operation === "-") {
                result = num1 - num2;
                document.write(`The result of ${num1} ${operation} ${num2} is: ${result}`);

            } else if (operation === "*") {
                result = num1 * num2;
                document.write(`The result of ${num1} ${operation} ${num2} is: ${result}`);

            } else if (operation === "/") {
                if (num2 !== 0) {
                    result = num1 / num2;
                    document.write(`The result of ${num1} ${operation} ${num2} is: ${result}`);

                } else {
                    document.write("Error: Division by zero!");
                }
            }
        } else {
            document.write("Invalid operation. Please enter a valid operator.");
        }
    </script> -->

<!-- 
 Question 5:Discount System Based on Purchase Amount
Write a program that asks for the total purchase amount and applies a discount based on the amount:
- No discount for purchases below $100.
- 5% discount for purchases from $100 to $499.
- 10% discount for purchases from $500 to $999.
- 15% discount for purchases $1000 and above.
Calculate and display the final price after discount. Use nested `if` statements to check the ranges and apply discounts. -->


<script>
let purchaseAmount = parseInt(prompt("Enter the total purchase amount: $"));
let finalPrice;

if (purchaseAmount < 100) {
    finalPrice = purchaseAmount;
} else if (purchaseAmount >= 100 && purchaseAmount < 500) {
    finalPrice = purchaseAmount * 0.95; // 5% discount
} else if (purchaseAmount >= 500 && purchaseAmount < 1000) {
    finalPrice = purchaseAmount * 0.9; // 10% discount
} else {
    finalPrice = purchaseAmount * 0.85; // 15% discount
}

console.log("Final price after discount: $" + finalPrice);
